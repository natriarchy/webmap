Other permitted uses include parks, community residences, garages, ground floor retail, office or services, and day care. Areas zoned R-4 encourage residential character and do not permit some forms of commercial uses. Neighborhood services such as assisted living facilities, nursing homes, child care centers, community centers, places of worship, and schools are permitted only with conditions.</p><p>R-4 zoning is generally applied in areas of neighborhoods with a mix of single-, two-, three-family homes and townhomes, but with a predominance of low-rise, multi-family homes, such as those found in large sections of Belmont, the residential sections of University Heights and portions of most Newark neighborhoods, including Upper and Lower Clinton Hill and the Ironbound. These areas are generally characterized by more densely packed homes and multifamily buildings that are four stories or less on very little yard space, giving them a more urban, residential feel.</p>",

Neighborhood services such as assisted living facilities, nursing homes, child care centers, community centers, places of worship, and primary and secondary schools are permitted only with conditions, as are urban farms, home professional offices, portable storage units, private sports courts and solar and wind energy systems.</p><p>R-5 zoning is generally applied in areas of neighborhoods with a mix of both low- and mid-rise, multi-family buildings, such as those found in pockets of many Newark neighborhoods including Upper and Lower Roseville and the Ironbound. These areas are generally characterized by dense complexes of residential buildings up to eight stories in height on small, shared grounds, giving them a strong urban, residential feel.</p>",

Other permitted uses include parks, community residences, garages, ground floor retail, office or services, and day care. Areas zoned R-6 encourage residential character and do not permit some types of commercial or retail uses. Uses such as assisted living facilities, nursing homes, child care centers, commercial antennas & microwave dishes, community centers, places of worship and primary and secondary schools are permitted only with conditions, as are urban farms, home professional offices, portable storage units, private sports courts and solar and wind energy systems.</p><p>R-6 zoning is generally applied in areas of neighborhoods with a mix of low-, mid-, and high-rise multi-family buildings, such as those found in portions of numerous Newark neighborhoods, including Forest Hill, Lower Broadway, University Heights, Vailsburg, and Weequahic. These areas are generally characterized by dense complexes of residential buildings up to ten stories in height on small, shared grounds, giving them a very strong urban, residential feel.</p>",

New develoment must be at least three stories high. C-2 zones are typically the heart of a neighborhood’s central commercial district. There are more permitted uses in C-2 zones than in C-1.</p><p>C-2 zoning is generally applied in existing community commercial centers, such as Bloomfield Avenue as it passes through Upper Roseville, Forest Hill and Lower Broadway; Orange Street in Lower Roseville; Central Avenue in Fairmount; South Orange Avenue as it passes through Vailsburg, Fairmount, and West Side; Ferry Street in the Ironbound; and number of smaller sections of nearly all of Newark’s neighborhoods. Surrounded by a mix of low- mid-rise residential buildings and often along vibrant streets, these areas are typically a community’s center of vibrancy.</p>",

I-1 zoning is applied in such places as along Oraton Street in North Broadway/Woodside; along 3rd Street in Upper Roseville; along N 13th Street in Lower Roseville; along Routes 1 & 9 in the Ironbound; between W Runyon Street and Peddie Street in Lower Clinton Hill; and in the Industrial District along much of the borderwith Lower Clinton Hill, as well as small pockets of other Newark neighborhoods.</p>",

I-2 zoning is applied in areas of Newark neighborhoods such as along McCarter Highway and the Passaic River waterfront in North Broadway/Woodside; around S 15th Street in Fairmount; north of Raymond Boulevard in the Ironbound; and in portions of the Newark Industrial District that border Lower Clinton Hill and the Ironbound.</p>",

These are the kinds of places where residents live over shops that offer everyday services, places to work, shop and play. MX-1 zoning allows for moderately dense residential development, permitting single-, two- and three-family homes and town homes up to three stories high, as well as low-rise, multi-family housing up to four stories high. Commercial development in MX-1 zones allows for ground-floor commercial with commercial or residential above.</p><p>MX-1 zoning is applied in areas where there is already a well-integrated mix of residential and commercial uses, such as along Verona Avenue in North Broadway/Woodside; along Broadway in Mount Pleasant; along Morris and Central Avenues in University Heights; along Broad Street in Lincoln Park and throughout large sections of the Ironbound.</p>",

        "DESCRIPTION": "<p>Mixed Use 2: Residential, Commercial, Industrial (MX-2) zoning allows for a blend of residential, commercial, and appropriate industrial uses within the same building or district, fostering flexible, working communities with integrated and innovative uses. These are the kinds of places where homes and businesses mix with industry in creative and productive ways. MX-2 zoning allows for moderately dense residential development, permitting single-, two- and three-family homes and town homes up to three stories high as well as low-rise multi-family housing up to four stories high. Commercial development in MX-2 zones allows for some ground-floor commercial with commercial or residential above. MX-2 also allows for industrial development, encouraging most industrial uses permitted in the I-1 District.</p><p>MX-2 zoning is applied in areas where there is already a well-integrated mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses, such as along Verona Avenue in Forest Hill; along Broad Street in Lower Broadway; around Central Avenue in University Heights; in small sections of Upper Clinton Hill; along the many of the edges of the Ironbound; and along Route 27 in Dayton.</p>",

It builds upon Newark’s strength as a multimodal transportation hub to support the Downtown Core District, expand housing and economic opportunities along the area’s major streets and transportation corridors and protect adjacent low-density neighborhoods. It promotes a walkable neighborhood with a vibrant commercial/retail zone. The district’s bulk standards allow taller buildings - up to one hundred forty-five (145) feet high with a minimum lot area per dwelling unit of two hundred (200) square feet</p><p>Commercial development in MX-3 zones allows for ground-floor commercial use with commercial or residential uses above.</p><p>MX-3 zoning is applied in areas where there is some existing mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses, such as along Lafayette Street, Union Street and Ferry Street and in under-utilized areas near Newark Penn Station where the predominant use is surface parking, such as along New Jersey Railroad Avenue, Bruen Street, McWhorter Street, Prospect Street and Congress Street.</p>",
